# Task-1B

This is a simple model to predict the ratings of the product based on the data given.

You can directly run the training_script.py on the command line like this 

> python training_script.py 

The following are the requirements to run the above file:
<ul>
<li>python version 3.9.6</li>
<li>requirements.txt</li>
<li>data folder as it consists of training data</li>
</ul>

This runs a model and creates a .pkl file in the output folder.

I am also adding the jupyter notebook file which I have used to build the model. It can be messy as I am playing with data.
